# Building a replica of Discord using React and TailwindCSS ! 

### I decided to make a replica of Discord to learn more about styling with TailwindCSS.

### This README will be used as a summary of every new things I have learned while making this project with a screenshot of what it does on the replica

### The first thing I added to my replica is a side bar with a bunch of icons to fill the side bar to make it less empty.

### Here I have just created two components, a sidebar component and a sidebar-icons component, the only new thing that I have used is the tailwind class system that allow us to apply style on specific classes (just like CSS lul, nothing really special here, I just wanted to try it)

### After this, I added a hover function on the icons (with the hover function of tailwind)

### I also added an another hover function that display a little text when you're on an icon, for that, I have used the ***group*** tailwind function.

### How does it work ? It's really simple, you declared a parent div with the ***group*** function, so every "child" of this div will see his state change when the state of the parent div change.
